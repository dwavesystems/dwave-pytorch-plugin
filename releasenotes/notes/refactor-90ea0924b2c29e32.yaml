prelude: >
    Refactor ``GraphRestrictedBoltzmannMachine`` to be defined by node and edge lists.
features:
    - Support hidden units.
upgrade:
    - Decouple sampling parameters (beta) from the model.
    - Reduce number of operations in the GRBM objective function.
    - Remove networkx dependency.
    - Simplify ``GraphRestrictedBoltzmannMachine`` constructor to require only node and edge lists.
deprecations:
    - Simplify ``GraphRestrictedBoltzmannMachine`` constructor to require only node and edge lists.
    - Remove abstract base class.
